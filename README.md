# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples and explanations of various software design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They can help improve code maintainability, flexibility, and readability.

1. **Abstract Factory**: Family Creator - Makes groups of related items.
2. **Builder**: Lego Master - Builds objects step by step, keeping creation and appearance.
3. **Prototype**: Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples.
4. **Singleton**: One and Only - A special class with just one instance.
5. **Adapter**: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.
6. **Bridge**: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.
7. **Composite**: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.
8. **Decorator**: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.
9. **Facade**: One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface.
10. **Flyweight**: Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently.
11. **Proxy**: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.
12. **Chain of Responsibility**: Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled.
13. **Command**: Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action.
14. **Iterator**: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.
15. **Mediator**: Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes.
16. **Memento**: Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state.
17. **Observer**: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.
18. **Visitor**: Skillful Guest - Adds new operations to a class without altering it.
